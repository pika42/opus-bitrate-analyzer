Welcome to the **Opus Bitrate Analyzer**! This Python script allows you to analyze the bitrate-time characteristics of audio files created with the libopus and vorbis codecs. It supports various formats including `.opus`, `.ogg`, and `.mka`. With this tool, you can visualize the relationship between bitrate and time through informative plots.

## Features

- Analyze bitrate over time for audio files.
- Generate plots to visualize the bitrate vs. time.
- Support for `.opus`, `.ogg`, and `.mka` file formats.
- Easy to use with simple command-line interface.
- Lightweight and efficient.

## Installation

To get started, you need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once you have Python installed, follow these steps to install the required libraries:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pika42/opus-bitrate-analyzer.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd opus-bitrate-analyzer
   ```

3. Install the required packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Now you are ready to use the Opus Bitrate Analyzer!

## Usage

To analyze an audio file, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python analyzer.py <path_to_audio_file>
```

Replace `<path_to_audio_file>` with the path to your `.opus`, `.ogg`, or `.mka` file. The script will generate a plot showing the bitrate over time.

### Example

For example, if you have a file named `example.opus`, you would run:

```bash
python analyzer.py example.opus
```

The output will be a visual representation of the bitrate changes throughout the audio file.

## Supported Formats

The Opus Bitrate Analyzer supports the following audio file formats:

- `.opus`: The Opus codec is designed for high-quality audio streaming and compression.
- `.ogg`: A free, open container format that can encapsulate various audio codecs.
- `.mka`: A Matroska audio file format, often used for high-quality audio.

## How It Works

The Opus Bitrate Analyzer reads the audio file and extracts the bitrate information over time. It uses libraries such as `numpy` for numerical operations and `matplotlib` for plotting the data. 

1. **File Reading**: The script opens the audio file and reads its metadata.
2. **Data Extraction**: It extracts bitrate data at regular intervals.
3. **Plotting**: Finally, it generates a plot to visualize the bitrate changes.

This process allows you to see how the bitrate varies, which can help in assessing audio quality and compression efficiency.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how the analyzer can be used:

### Example 1: Analyzing an Opus File

```bash
python analyzer.py my_audio.opus
```

This command will analyze the `my_audio.opus` file and produce a bitrate vs. time plot.

### Example 2: Analyzing an Ogg File

```bash
python analyzer.py my_audio.ogg
```

Similar to the previous example, this command will analyze an Ogg file.

### Example 3: Analyzing an MKA File

```bash
python analyzer.py my_audio.mka
```

This command allows you to analyze an MKA file, providing insights into its bitrate.
